This blog site is designed for quick tutorial & tips.  

For my full featured data science post&project, please refers to my [full site](https://bsunfullsite.github.io/#projects) and search for tags(e.g., R, data science, etc), where *R markdown* is supported and I could show some code chunks and the result of actually running them.
